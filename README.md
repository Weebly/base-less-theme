#Weebly Base Theme - LESS Version

## Get Started with Weebly Themes

Themes provide the general look and feel used throughout a website. While Weebly provides a number of great themes, you may find you want to change a few things in a theme. Or maybe you want to change everything! You can do those and everything in between. And once you're done, you can use it on your site or share with your client or friends.

A Weebly theme provides a general structure and design palette for any website built using the Weebly editor. Weebly strives to provide ultimate flexibility for our users, so our themes don't dictate a template or a mandatory organization of content. Instead, they provide a beautiful backdrop for the site's content.

To get started, create a web site that you can use to test your theme. Then download our Base theme as a starting point, and start building from there! Or find a theme you mostly like and then change the things you don't.
